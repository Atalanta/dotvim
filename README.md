My Vim Config
=============

I copy this repository to every computer I work on. After I've run the
`install` script I've got a fully capable  editor (both the GUI version
-- gvim or MacVim) and a console version.

It makes for an easy life.

Feel free to have a poke around, but I recommend building up your own
Vim config by hand from all the blog posts and examples you can find on
the Internet. You'll learn so much more that way, and it'll make you a
more effective programmer.
