My Vim Config
=============

I install this repository to every computer I work on:

    $ git clone github@github.com:gma/dotvim.git ~/.vim
    $ git submodule update --init

Feel free to have a poke around, but I recommend building up your own
Vim config by hand from all the blog posts and examples you can find on
the Internet. You'll learn so much more that way, and it'll make you a
more effective programmer.
